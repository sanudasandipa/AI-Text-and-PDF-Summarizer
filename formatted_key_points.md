# Cloud Computing and Storage - Lecture Outline Key Points

This document is a lecture outline on cloud compute and storage, not a research paper. Therefore, it lacks research objectives, methodology, key findings, conclusions, and significant academic contributions. However, we can extract key concepts covered:

## **Key Concepts Covered in the Lecture Outline:**

### **Virtualization and Containerization:**
- The lecture recaps the differences between virtualization (using hypervisors, Type 1 and Type 2) and containerization (using Docker, focusing on reduced dependencies).

### **Software-Defined Compute:**
- Explains the concept of abstracting compute functions from underlying hardware, allowing for flexible resource pooling and workload distribution across generic hardware components.

### **Cloud Compute Services (Examples: Amazon EC2 and Azure VMs):**
- Details the provision of virtual machines as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) by major cloud providers
- Highlights pre-configured templates (AMIs and marketplace images) and per-second/minute billing models

### **Compute Instance Types:**
- Categorizes instances based on their optimization:
  - **General purpose**
  - **Compute-optimized**
  - **Memory-optimized**
  - **Storage-optimized**
  - **Accelerated computing**
  - **Burstable**

### **Tenancy and Purchasing Options:**
- Discusses different tenancy models:
  - **Shared**
  - **Dedicated instances**
  - **Dedicated hosts**
- Purchasing options:
  - **On-demand**
  - **Reserved**
  - **Spot instances**
  - **Savings plans**

### **Compute Instance Lifecycle:**
- Briefly mentions the lifecycle management aspects of EC2 and Azure VMs

### **Placement Groups:**
- Introduces the concept of placement groups for optimizing instance placement based on specific needs:
  - **AWS:** cluster, partition, spread
  - **Azure:** proximity

## **Summary:**

The document primarily provides an overview of fundamental cloud computing concepts and services, not research-based findings. Therefore, points relating to research are not applicable.
